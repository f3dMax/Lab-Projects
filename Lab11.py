# 1. Create a class called Product. The class should have the following attributes in the __init__ method:
# name -> this should be a string
# price -> this should be a float
# product_id (this should be a unique number)
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price, product_id):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.product_id = product_id

 # 2. Create a method called __str__ that returns a string with the following format:
 # Product: <name>, Price: <price>, ID: <product_id>
 # Hint: use f-strings to format the string.
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Product: {self.name}, Price: {self.price}, ID: {self.product_id}"


# Great now that we have a Product lets create a Customer class.
# 3. Create a class called Customer. The class should have the following attributes in the __init__ method:
# name -> this should be a string
# customer_id (this should be a unique number)
# cart -> this should be a list that contains Product objects.

# 4. Create a method called add_to_cart that takes in a Product object and adds it to the cart list. print out the product that was added and the customer's name.

    def remove_from_cart(self, product):
        self.cart.remove(product)
# 6. Create a method called checkout calculates the total price of all the products in the cart and prints out the total. After printing out the total, empty the cart.
# Hint: you will need to loop through the cart and add up the prices.

    def display_products(self):
        for product in self.cart:
                print(product)

# 8. **Extra** Create a method called display_products_pretty that prints out all the products in the cart list. (use the tabulate library)
# Make a nice table table using the tabulate library.

# products -> this should be a list that contains Product objects.
# customers -> this should be a list that contains Customer objects.

# 8. Create a method called add_product that takes in a Product object and adds it to the products list.

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products.append(product)


# 9. Create a method called add_customer that takes in a Customer object and adds it to the customers list.
    def add_customer(self, customer):
        self.customers.append(customer)

# 10. Create a method called display_products that prints out all the products in the products list.
    def display_products(self):
        for product in self.products:
            print(product)
# 11. Create a method called display_customers that prints out all the customers in the customers list.

        for customer in self.customers:
            print(customer)
# Typically we would create another file and import the classes we created. For this lab, we will just create the objects in this file to show how its possible.

# 12. Create a store object called store.

# product_id: 1

# price: 999.99
# product_id: 2

# name: "iPhone 12 Pro Max"
# price: 1099.99
# product_id: 3

product3 = Product("iPhone 12 Pro Max", 1099.99, 3)
# 16. Create a customer object called customer1 with the following attributes:
# name: "John"
# customer_id: 1
customer1 = Customer("John", 1)
# 17. Create a customer object called customer2 with the following attributes:
# name: "Jane"
# customer_id: 2

# 18. Add product1 to the store using the add_product method.
store.add_product(product1)
# 19. Add product2 to the store using the add_product method.
store.add_product(product2)
# 20. Add product3 to the store using the add_product method.

store.add_customer(customer1)
# 22. Add customer2 to the store using the add_customer method.

# 23. Add product1 to customer1's cart using the add_to_cart method.
customer1.add_to_cart(product1)

# 24. Add product2 to customer1's cart using the add_to_cart method.
customer1.add_to_cart(product2)
# 25. Add product3 to customer2's cart using the add_to_cart method.
customer2.add_to_cart(product3)
# 26. Display current products in customer1's cart using the display_products method.
customer1.display_products()
# 27. Display current products in customer2's cart using the display_products method.
customer2.display_products()

# 28. Checkout customer1's cart using the checkout method.
customer1.checkout()

# 29. Checkout customer2's cart using the checkout method.
